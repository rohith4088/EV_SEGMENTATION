EV Market Segmentation using two datasets mainly revovling around vehicle sepcification and behaviour sepcified 
1. Vehicle Specifications: This dataset contains information about the vehicles such as make, model, year of manufacture, body type, engine type, fuel type, transmission type, price etc.
2. behaviour specified: the dataset contains information the Age	Profession	Marrital Status	Education No_of_Dependents	Personal_loan	Total_Salary	Price
3. The segmentation of the data for both the dataset is done using KMeans Clustering, for the behaviour segmentation principle component analysis is done for dimensionality reduction of the data, and the each column and amde into eight principle compinents.
4. The final represntation for both the datasets are done using dendograms.
5. some relevangt graphs for vehicle sepcific segmentation
